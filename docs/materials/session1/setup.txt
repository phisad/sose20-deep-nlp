# Setting up PyTorch

Installing PyTorch on your own computer should be quite straightforward. There are instructions here: https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/

It seems that there may be problems in installing PyTorch on Windows. If you run into problems which are difficult to solve, you can also use Google Colaboratory: https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb It can be set up to install PyTorch. See the instructions below.

Another option on Windows is to install PyTorch via Anaconda. Instructions for installation are here: https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/install/windows.html If you would like a 3.x version of Python, you should select it explicitly during Anaconda installation, since the default version is 2.7. Through Anaconda, it is straightforward to install PyTorch and other libraries. You can also start Jupyter Notebooks from its interface.

# Setting up Jupyter Notebooks

(If you're new to Jupiter Notebooks, we recommend this link: https://www.dataquest.io/blog/jupyter-notebook-tutorial/)

You can install Jupyter Notebooks via conda or pip. Find the instructions here: https://jupyter.org/install

1. Setting up Jupyter Notebooks to work with conda environments:

Since conda has stopped automatically setting environments up as jupyter
kernels, you need to either manually add them, or install the nb_conda_kernels
package which does the setting up for you. Below are instructions to set up using the nb_conda_kernels package. For manual set up, you can refer to this stackoverflow post: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39604271/conda-environments-not-showing-up-in-jupyter-notebook

Using nb_conda_kernels package:

(You can find the complete instructions and explanations for installing this package here: https://github.com/Anaconda-Platform/nb_conda_kernels)

First, you need to install nb_conda_kernels package to the environment from which you run Jupyter Notebook. This might be your base conda environment, 

$ conda install nb_conda_kernels

but it need not be. For instance, if the environment notebook_env contains the notebook package, then you would run:

$ conda install -n notebook_env nb_conda_kernels

In addition, if your pytorch environment (which you are using for this project) and the notebook_env (the environment from which you will run jupyter notebooks) are different, then in the pytorch environment you should also install the ipykernel package. Say, if it is called pytorch_env:

$ conda install nb_conda_kernels

or 

$ conda install -n pytorch_env ipykernel
